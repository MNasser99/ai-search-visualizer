# AI Search Algorithms Visualizer
by Mohamed Abdelhafez

This is a Unity program that visualizes how different AI search algorithms work in a maze. This program was made as a personal project while enrolled in Harvard's [CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/) during the first lecture of the course.


#### This is the source code for the program. If you only want to run it you can either

- Download it as a windows application [here](https://mnasser99.itch.io/ai-search-visualizer/purchase). (Press skip at payment page for free download)


#### The program includes visualization of 4 search algorithms:
- Depth-first Search
- Breadth-first Search
- Greedy Best-first Search
- A* Search
